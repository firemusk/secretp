## Is Your Salary Good Enough? Key Factors to Consider

Determining whether your salary is good enough depends on several factors:

### 1. Sector and Role

Salaries vary significantly depending on the sector. For instance, working in an **EU institution** or **EU agency** often offers higher salaries and better benefits than working for an **NGO** or smaller consultancy. Positions in **public affairs** also tend to offer more competitive salaries compared to non-profit sectors.

### 2. Experience and Seniority

Experience and seniority play a major role in salary levels. **Junior roles** tend to offer lower salaries but can still cover basic living costs in Brussels. However, mid-level and senior roles, especially in **public affairs** or **EU institutions**, can offer significantly higher compensation.

### 3. Additional Benefits

Many positions in Brussels, particularly in **EU institutions** or **EU agencies**, offer benefits like **healthcare**, **pension contributions**, and **expat benefits**. These perks add considerable value to your overall compensation package and may offset higher living costs in the city.

### 4. Lifestyle Choices

Your lifestyle choices also impact what salary is "good" for you. For instance, living in the city center, dining out frequently, or traveling often may require a higher salary to sustain that lifestyle. Conversely, living in a more affordable area outside the center and budgeting more carefully can make a lower salary more manageable.
