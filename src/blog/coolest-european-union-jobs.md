The "EU bubble" offers an array of meaningful, impactful careers. EU careers, including public affairs roles, consistently operate at the forefront of technology and societal evolution. This article will focus on careers within EU institutions, particularly at European agencies.

## The Role of Democracy in the EU
Democracy operates as a natural check on hasty or harmful ideas, allowing good ideas to move forward slowly and thoughtfully. Rapid change is often associated with authoritarian regimes. In the EU, positions across its institutions reflect this cautious but progressive approach.

## European Union Positions – Starting with the European Parliament

One of the most engaging roles in the European Parliament (EP) is that of an **Accredited Parliamentary Assistant (APA)**. A close friend of mine, an APA, finds immense satisfaction in the work. APAs work with both civil servants and political appointees, often balancing administrative tasks with high-level responsibilities like drafting speeches and developing strategies (for example, advocating for Romania’s accession to Schengen).

APAs frequently interact with EU public affairs professionals, often the primary point of contact for lobbyists. Observing parliament can feel a bit like a theater production, with each parliamentarian following the cues of the party whip. When the whip signals, the entire group moves in unison, adding to the dynamic, almost performative, environment of the EP.

## The European Commission: The Heart of Power

The **European Commission** holds substantial influence over EU policy, where **policy officers** often shape the legislation process. Policy officers not only initiate regulatory proposals but frequently draft key parts of legislation that move to other EU institutions for further debate and approval.

A friend of mine who worked on digital market regulations spent over 14-hour days knowing his work directly influenced the future of digital interoperability. For instance, policies he helped shape could prevent companies like Apple from restricting the use of competing services (like Chrome or Google Maps on iPhones), ultimately benefiting consumers by providing more choice and promoting fair competition.

## The Council and European Union Agencies: An Insider’s View

Working at the **Council of the EU** is often a more discreet career path. Many **Permanent Representatives (Perm Reps)** are highly skilled diplomats or advisors who rarely disclose specifics of their work, typically describing it only as "working for the EU institutions." Among EU careers, Perm Rep roles are among the most prestigious, featuring unique roles with historical names like **Mertens Coordinator** or **Antici**.

Perm Reps approach public affairs professionals with caution, given their role frequently overlaps with lobbying efforts in the Parliament and the Commission. This dual role allows Perm Reps to influence key decisions, providing a direct line to ministers, which lobbyists would otherwise find challenging to reach.

### The Most Fun and Flexible: EU Public Affairs Jobs

Among EU careers, **Perm Rep and public affairs roles** are among the most engaging. Many lobbyists in EU public affairs enjoy the flexibility, frequent interactions with key figures, and, of course, the chance to casually walk through the European Parliament for coffee or lunch. 

### A Hidden Gem: The Single Resolution Board (SRB) – EU’s Financial Safety Net

An often-overlooked EU institution, the **Single Resolution Board (SRB)**, functions like the EU’s version of the FDIC, safeguarding citizens' bank deposits. Though less known, the SRB plays a crucial role in European stability, ensuring that even in a bank collapse, individuals are protected (up to around €200,000). This agency manages common debt funds, acting for the common good much like the European Central Bank but without widespread recognition.

The SRB may seem remote, but it’s one of the EU’s most forward-thinking institutions, supporting financial resilience across Europe. It exemplifies the unseen, often underappreciated work done by EU agencies to protect and advance the Union’s collective stability and welfare.

In conclusion, EU institutions offer some of the most diverse, impactful roles available in public service today. Whether working on legislation in the Commission, supporting parliamentarians, or ensuring financial safety in the SRB, each role contributes uniquely to the European Union’s complex and dynamic governance system.
